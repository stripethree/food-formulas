# Pizza Crust

### Components

* 3 c flour
* 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) instant yeast
* 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* 1 1/3 cups warm water
* Cornmeal

### Assembly
* In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine all ingredients except cornmeal, leaving out a small amount of the water
* Stir manually with the dough hook until a loose dough forms; add water and/or flour as needed
* Attach the dough hook to the mixer and start on a low speed, gradually increasing the speed to medium until a ball forms
* Once the dough forms into a ball, allow the mixer to knead for 8 minutes at medium-high
* After the kneading is finished, brush the top of the dough gently with olive oil, cover the bowl with a damp towel, and allow to rise for 50 minutes
* After initial 50 minute prove, split the dough into 2 equal parts, brush the top of each with olive oil, cover with a damp towel, and allow to rise for another 10 minutes

### Notes
* Pre-baking: The best results we have seen are to pre-heat a pizza stone in the oven to 500*. Once a boule is worked into a circle and spread on the pre-heated stone, bake it for 5-6 mins without toppings. Bake for an additional 5-6 minutes after adding toppings.
