# Pizza Crust

### Components

* 3 c flour
* 2 teaspoons (1 packet) instant yeast
* 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* 1 1/3 cups warm water
* Cornmeal

### Assembly
* In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine all ingredients except cornmeal
* Stir until a loose dough forms
* Attach the dough hook to the mixer and start on a low speed, gradually increasing the speed to medium until a ball forms
* Once the dough forms into a ball, allow the mixer to knead for 8 minutes at medium-high
* After the kneading is finished, divide the dough in half and shape each dough into a boule
* Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise for 1 hour

### Notes
* Proving: Prepare two bowls with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon of flour. Place a boule in each bowl and rotate to cover in flour and oil before setting aside to rise. This will keep the dough moist and allow it to be removed from the bowl cleanly.
* Pre-baking: The best results we have seen are to pre-heat a pizza stone in the oven to 500*. Once a boule s worked into a circle and spread on the pre-heated stone, bake it for 5-6 mins without toppings. Bake for an additional 5-6 minutes after adding toppings.
