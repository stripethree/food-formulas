# Banana Bread Muffins

### Components

* 2 cups ripe, mashed bananas
* 6 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 c white sugar
* 3/4 ts salt
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 egg
* 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 ts baking soda
* 1 ts baking powder
* 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips

### Assembly
* Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl
* In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar together
* Add the egg and vanilla and beat.
* Add the dry ingredients and mashed banana into the butter and egg mixture
* Fold in the chocolate chips
* For muffins, bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes

### Notes
I also use this to make banana bread; generally that needs to bake for 40-45 minutes.
I think I also throw some cinnamon into this also.
