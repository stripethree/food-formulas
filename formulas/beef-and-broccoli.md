# Slow Cooker Beef and Broccoli

### Components

* 2 lb beef (flank steak)
* 12 oz broccoli
* 3 c cauliflower rice
* 1 ts olive oil

_Marinade_
* 1/2 c coconut aminos
* 1/2 c beef broth
* 2 tbs rice wine vinegar
* 1/3 c honey
* 1 tbs fresh garlic minced
* 1/2 tbs fresh ginger grated (or 1 ts ground ginger)
* 1 ts pepper
* 1 tbs sesame seeds


### Assembly
* In a bowl mix together marinade. Pour marinade in slow cooker. Stir in beef until coated.
* Cook on low for 6 hours.
* Once cooked, remove the liquid from the slow cooker and pour into a large pan over the stove. Bring the sauce to a boil. Boil on high for 15 minutes. The sauce should be at a rolling boil bubbling the entire time. Whisk occasionally to prevent sauce from burning.
* While sauce is boiling, cook broccoli. Place in a microwave safe dish with 1/4 cup water and microwave on high for 3-4 minutes. 
* While broccoli is cooking, lightly sauté cauliflower rice in a pan with 1 teaspoon olive oil.
* Once sauce has thickened add in cooked meat to the pan, stir to coat with sauce. You can break up the steak by pressing them gently as you stir if you’d like more shredded beef. It should easily fall apart.
* Assemble bowls with cauliflower rice, broccoli, and beef.

### Notes
* If doing Whole30, substitute 100% apple juice for honey.
