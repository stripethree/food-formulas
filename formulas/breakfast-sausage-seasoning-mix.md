# Breakfast Sausage Seasoning Mix

### Components

* 1 tbs salt
* 1 tbs ground black pepper
* 1 1/2 ts ground thyme
* 1 1/2 ts dried rubbed sage
* 3/4 ts ground allspice
* 3/4 ts cayenne red pepper flakes
* 1/2 ts ground nutmeg

### Usage
* Use 4 tsp for each pound of ground pork for breakfast sausage

### Notes
- Derived as a Whole 30 compliant version of the blend in the [Breakfast Sausage Patties](https://github.com/stripethree/food-formulas/blob/master/formulas/breakfast-sausage-patties.md) recipe
- Works equally well on patties or ground sausage for things like breakfast tacos
