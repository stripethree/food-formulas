### Notes
This recipe never seems to come out the same way twice, probably because I have
experimented with it and not kept good notes on how well things have worked.
I generally use sharp cheddar for half of the cheese and some kind of spicy
cheese for the other half; there's a 3 pepper Colby jack that works well.
The sauce works best when it is moderately thick. When poured over the casserole,
it should not seep through the rest of the casserole.
