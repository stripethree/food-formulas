# Buffalo Chicken Spaghetti Squash Boats

### Components

* 1 large spaghetti squash
* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts
* 1 c broccoli, chopped
* 1 c shredded cheese
* 1/3 c Frank's Red Hot Sauce
* 1/2 c nonfat greek yogurt
* 1 ts pepper
* green onions, sliced, optional


### Assembly
* Preheat oven to 400.
* Prepare a lined baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat baking sheet; spray sheet with olive oil.
* Slice the spaghetti squash lengthwise, remove seeds + place on baking sheet. 
* Spray the spaghetti squash with olive oil and place open face up. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes.
* After 10 minutes, remove the sheet from the oven and add whole chicken breasts to the sheet. Spray chicken breasts with olive oil and return to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes.
* While the spaghetti squash is cooking, mix together broccoli, cheese, hot sauce, yogurt, and pepper.
* Once the spaghetti squash is cooked, shred by pulling at the center with a fork. Remove about half of the squash from the skins. 
* Shred chicken by pulling apart with two forks. Add shredded chicken and and shredded spaghetti squash filling to the the veggie/cheese/yogurt mixture.
* Stuff the spaghetti squash skins with the mixture and put back into the oven for 12 minutes
* Optional: For the last 2 minutes turn the oven on Broil/High to get an extra brown, crispy, cheesy top
