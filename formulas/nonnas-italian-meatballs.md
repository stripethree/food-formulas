# Nonna's Italian Meatballs

### Components

* 1 large onion, diced small (set aside 1/2 for the sauce)
* 4 cloves of minced garlic (set aside 1/2 for the sauce)
* 1/3 cup almond flour
* 2 eggs, whisked
* 1/4 cup of fresh, chopped flat-leaf parsley
* Pinch of red pepper flakes

_Sauce_
* 1 can (28 oz) San Marzano Plum Tomatoes in Sauce
* 1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce
* The other half of the diced onions and minced garlic (see meatball ingredients above)
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp dried basil
* 2 tbs fresh chopped parsley
* 1/2 to 1 tsp of sea salt
* pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)

### Assembly
* Sauté onions in 2 tbs of olive oil for 5-7 minutes
* Next season with salt, add garlic, and cook for one additional minute
* Remove from heat
* Add half of the onion/garlic to the crockpot, and set the other half aside
* Add remaining ingredients for the sauce into crock pot
* Break apart the tomatoes in the crock pot so they are not whole
* Set crockpot to low
* Add ground beef to the bowl you set aside of the chopped onions and minced garlic
* Add the rest of the meatball ingredients to the same bowl
* GENTLY combine all the meatball ingredients with your hands – do not over mix or your meatballs will turn out tough
* Preheat a medium or large frying pan with few tablespoons of coconut or olive oil over medium heat
* Form meatballs by hand -- make each about the size of a golf ball
* Place meatballs in the heated frying pan, to get a nice brown on the surface. (they should still be raw in the center and will be cooked through in the crock pot)
* Transfer browned meatballs directly into the crock pot
* Cook in crock pot on low 4-6 hours
* Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot
