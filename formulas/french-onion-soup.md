# French Onion Soup

### Components
* 4 c yellow or sweet onions, sliced
* 4 tbs unsalted butter
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/4 tsp sugar
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 6 c low sodium beef broth
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/8 tsp dried thyme
* salt, to taste
* baguette slices
* grated parmesan cheese
* Gruyere or mozzarella cheese

### Assembly
* Heat the butter and add the sliced onions, stir in the black pepper and sugar
* Heat over medium or med-low heat, stirring occasionally, until they caramelize
* Add the garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute
* Add the broth, bay leaf, and thyme and stir
* Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer partially covered for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally
* While soup is cooking, brush the baguette slices with butter or olive oil and toast lightly.
* When soup is done, remove the bay leaf. Add a little salt to taste.
* Sprinkle toasted baguettes with Parmesan cheese and gruyere or mozzarella. Toast or broil until melted and slightly browned.
* Add baguette slices to bowls of soup.

### Notes
If you have bowls that can withstand the heat, you can put the toasted baguettes in the soup after you've ladled it out into bowls, add the cheeses on top and put it under the broiler for a little bit until melted and slightly browned - it cooks very fast so you have to watch it closely.
