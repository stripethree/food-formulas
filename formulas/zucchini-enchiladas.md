# Low-Carb Zucchini Enchiladas

### Components

* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 large onion, chopped
* kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
* 1 Tbsp ancho chile powder
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 2 lbs cooked chicken breasts, shredded
* 1 1/2 C red enchilada sauce, divided
* 2 C shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided
* 4 green onions, green and white parts chopped and separated
* 1/4 C chopped fresh cilantro
* 4 large zucchini, thinly sliced lengthwise
* 1/2 C queso fresco, or more to taste
* 1/4 C sour cream (optional)
* 2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

### Assembly

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add chile powder, garlic, cumin, and sea salt; stir until combined. Add chicken and 1 cup enchilada sauce. Stir to combine and remove from heat. Let chicken mixture cool slightly.
3. Stir 1 cup cheddar cheese, white parts of green onions, and 1/4 cup cilantro into the chicken mixture. Pour 1/4 cup enchilada sauce into the bottom of a 9x11-inch baking dish.
4. Slightly overlap 3 slices of zucchini on a cutting board. Top with a small mound of the chicken mixture. Roll up and place in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining zucchini slices and chicken mixture. Spoon remaining 1/4 cup sauce over zucchini enchiladas. Sprinkle remaining 1 cup cheddar cheese and queso fresco on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 30 minutes. Garnish with green parts of green onions, sour cream, and cilantro.

### Notes

* Sourced from [this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/266758/low-carb-zucchini-enchiladas/)
* We use 1 whole rotisserie chicken for this recipe. Delicious and easy.
* The zucchini need to be medium to large — and we could probably get fewer than 4. We always run out of chicken mixture before zucchini.
