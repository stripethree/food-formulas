* Bake, stirring occasionally, until dried out, about 1 hour

- [Original Recipe](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/-simple-is-best-dressing-51124210)
- I have successfully used [Just Egg](https://www.ju.st/en-us/get-just-egg) as a substitute for the two large eggs
- This recipe is also quite good when using [Brown Butter Sandwich Bread](https://github.com/stripethree/food-formulas/blob/master/formulas/brown-butter-sandwich-bread.md)
