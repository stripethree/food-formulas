### Notes
Sourced from [this recipe](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pasta-with-sausage-and-arugula).
Recipe makes about 6 servings.

* The original recipe calls for 2 red onions, but we substituted 1 shallot and enjoyed the sweetness it brought.
* Parmesan can be sprinkled on top instead of tossed into pasta to avoid stickiness.
