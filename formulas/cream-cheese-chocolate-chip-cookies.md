# Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip Cookies

### Components

* 8 oz cream cheese, softened
* 1 c butter, melted and cooled
* 1 1/3 c packed light brown sugar
* 2/3 c granulated sugar
* 1 tbs vanilla extract
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 3 c all-purpose flour
* 2 c semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips

### Assembly
* Preheat the oven to 325 and line baking sheets with parchment or silpat liners
* In a large bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer, cream together the cream cheese, melted butter and sugars until light and fluffy
* Mix in the vanilla
* Add the dry ingredients and mix until mostly incorporated; a few dry streaks may remain
* Add the chocolate chips and mix until combined and no dry streaks remain
* Roll the dough into 1 to 1 1/2-inch balls and place about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets
Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand - just barely press, you donâ€™t need to flatten it all the way)
* Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes until the edges are just barely golden brown
* Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.

### Notes
This delicious, egg-free recipe courtesy of Jillian Zilch! Modified quantities since cream cheese always seems to come in 8 oz increments. New quantities yield ~72 cookies. Dough can be frozen after shaping too.

I have also tried this recipe substituting 1/2 the butter for shortening for an even softer, chewy cookie.
