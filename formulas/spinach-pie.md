# Spinach Pie

### Components

* 2 tbs butter
* 1/3 cup chopped white onion
* 1/3 cup chopped mushrooms
* 14 oz chopped fresh spinach
* 1 lb ricotta cheese
* 1/2 c grated Parmesan cheese
* 2 eggs or equivalent egg replacer
* 3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
* 1/4 teaspoon white pepper (I used black pepper)
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1 frozen 9"  pie shell

### Assembly
* Bake the pie shell according to the package directions and set aside to cool
* Melt  butter in skillet
* Saut√© the mushrooms and onion until onions turn clear
* Cook the spinach in boiling water for 90s
* Drain the spinach and press with a spoon to remove as much liquid as possible
* In a mixing bowl beat the two eggs or prepare the egg replacer
* Add the spinach, onions & mushrooms, ricotta, parmesan cheese, and seasonings to the eggs and mix well
* Pour spinach mixture into the pie shell, smoothly it out so it is distributed evenly
* Bake at 375 for about 45 minutes or until the top of the spinach starts to brown

### Notes
The original recipe used 1/2 c onion and no mushrooms. I was looking to cut back on the onion a little and add additional flavor with the mushrooms. The original recipe also used frozen spinach, which is easier to prepare since it can be bought pre-chopped.

This recipe informed me that I should learn how to make pie crusts because the store-bought frozen ones are bullshit.
