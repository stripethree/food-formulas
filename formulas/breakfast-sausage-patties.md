### Notes
Based loosely on [this recipe](http://www.travelinglowcarb.com/5068/low-carb-sausage-biscuit-recipe/).
Recipe makes about 12 patties.

I decided I want to forgo store bought "breakfast sausage" and do this from scratch. I based the changes on [this recipe](https://www.thespruce.com/homemade-pork-breakfast-sausage-3060593).

* I use Neat Egg for this recipe and find that it works great as the necessary binding agent.
* I use a 1/4c measuring cup to form each patty for a consistent shape. Cook times may vary depending on the size of the patty formed.
