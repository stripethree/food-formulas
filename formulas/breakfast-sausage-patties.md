# Breakfast Sausage Patties

### Components

* 1 tbs butter
* 2 large eggs or equivalent egg replacer
* 1/2 c diced onion
* 1/2 c diced green bell pepper
* 1/2 c almond flour
* 1/4 c shredded sharp cheddar cheese
* 1/4 c grated parmesan cheese
* 1 lb ground breakfast sausage


### Assembly
* Melt butter and combine with eggs or egg replacer in large bowl
* Add remaining ingredients except sausage and mix together
* Add sausage and mix in by hand
* Form into ~3 inch diameter patties and place on a cookie sheet
* Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or until starting to brown
* Flip patties and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until brown

### Notes
Based loosely on [this recipe](http://www.travelinglowcarb.com/5068/low-carb-sausage-biscuit-recipe/).
Recipe makes 12-14 patties.

* I have used HEB ground sausage, both the maple and the sage varieties for this recipe. The maple gives a
slightly sweeter final product and the sage a little more savory.
* I use Neat Egg for this recipe and find that it works great as the necessary binding agent.
* If you like a more golden brown color on the finished patties, broil them on each side for 2-3 minutes
after the baking.
