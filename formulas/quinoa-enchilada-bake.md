### Assembly

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
2. Lightly spray a 9 x 12 baking dish with oil.
3. In a medium saucepan cook the quinoa with 1 3/4 cups broth according to package instructions; when cooked, fluff with a fork and set aside.
4. Meanwhile in a small saucepan heat the oil over medium low heat. Add the garlic and saute until golden, about 1 - 2 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, 1/4 tsp kosher salt, cumin, 1/4 cup broth and chipotle en adobo. If it's too thick, add 2 tbsp water to thin out. Bring to a boil and simmer 3 to 4 minutes.
5. In a large bowl combine the cooked quinoa, green chiles, corn, black beans and 1/4 cup cilantro. Stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese and mix will. Place into the baking dish and spread out. Top with the enchilada sauce and remaining cheese.
6. Cover with foil and bake until hot the cheese is melted, about 20 to 25 minutes.
7. To serve, top with avocado, scallions and remaining fresh cilantro. Cut into 6 pieces and serve right away.

### Notes

* We used at least 2 tablespoons of chipotle en adobo sauce and it was delicious. Next time we should maybe chop the chipotle peppers before adding them to the sauce.
