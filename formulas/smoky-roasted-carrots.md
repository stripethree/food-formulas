# Smoky Roasted Carrots

### Components

* 3/4 lb carrots
* olive oil
* 1 Tbsp smoky spice blend
  * smoked paprika
  * sweet paprika
  * ground yellow mustard
  * garlic powder
  * onion powder


### Assembly
* Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450ÂºF
* Peel the carrots; halve crosswise, then quarter lengthwise (you should end up with spears similar in size to steak fries)
* Line a sheet pan with foil
* Toss the carrots with a drizzle of olive oil; season with salt, pepper, and enough of the smoky spice blend to coat
* Arrange the carrots in an even layer on the sheet pan
* Roast 17-19 minutes or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork

### Notes
* Sourced from [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/discontinued-jalapeno-burgers-with-goat-cheese-smoky-roasted-carrots).
* Blue Apron doesn't mention specific ratios for their [smoky spice blend](https://www.blueapron.com/market/products/spice-blend-no-3), but approximately equal parts should be okay?
