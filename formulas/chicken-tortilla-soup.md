# Chicken Tortilla Soup

### Components

1 medium onion, chopped
1 medium bell pepper chopped
3 jalapeños, deseeded and diced
1 ts olive oil
2 ts chopped garlic
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 bay leaves
1 lb chicken, cooked and shredded
1 (15 oz) can whole peeled tomatoes
1 (10 oz) can enchilada sauce
4 c low sodium beef broth
4 c low sodium chicken broth
6 chile de arbol, dried
1 chicken bullion cube

### Assembly
* Sauteé onion, bell pepper, and jalapeños in olive oil until onions are translucent
* Stir in garlic and spices
* Add chopped tomatoes and bring to a simmer
* Place shredded chicken in a large pot and cover with simmered tomato and vegetable mixture
* Add beef broth, chicken broth, enchilada sauce, chiles, and chicken bullion cube
* Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour
* Serve with fresh cilantro, tortilla chips, cheese, avocado, etc.

### Notes
For the chicken, I used a whole roasted chicken from HEB. Got as much meat out of it as possible, discarded the skin.

Some notes from Kalinda's original recipe that I might make use of in the future:
* deglaze veggie pan with broths to get all the flavors!
* use a dutch oven for soups since you can use an emulsifier and they seem to enhance the flavor
* this makes a lot of freakin' soup
