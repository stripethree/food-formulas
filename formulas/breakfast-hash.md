### Notes
For an extra kick, use a bit of hot Hungarian paprika on the potatoes.

If the mixture is too wet for your taste or you like the potatoes a little crispy, broil the mixture in a casserole disk for a few minutes. Add cheese if you like, which really means, you should add cheese.

Lastly, if you like a little sweeter touch, toss a 1/2 c of raisins in at the end, or throw a few on an individual serving.
