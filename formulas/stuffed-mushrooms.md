# Stuffed Mushrooms

### Components

* whole mushrooms, (~3 dozen to use all the filling)
* 1/2 c diced red onion
* 4-5 jalapeños, deseeded and diced
* 1 lb bacon
* 1/2 c feta
* 1/2 c shredded spicy cheddar cheese
* 8 oz cream cheese

### Assembly
* Cook bacon on the stovetop until crispy and set aside to cool
* Sauteé onion and jalapeño in bacon grease
* Mix onion, jalapeño, and cheeses in a bowl
* Once bacon has cooled, crumble and fold into cheese mixture
* Wash mushrooms, remove stems and place on a baking sheet
* Bake at 375 degrees for 10-23 minutes, until water forms in the caps
* Remove mushrooms from the oven, let cool, and empty water from caps
* Add filling mixture to mushrooms caps and bake at 375* for 10-12 minutes, until cheeses have melted together

### Notes
I have also used yellow or sweet onions instead of red for this recipe.
I prefer to use [Boar's Head 3 Pepper Colby Jack](https://boarshead.com/products/detail/15061-3-pepper-colby-jack-cheese) cheese for this recipe.
