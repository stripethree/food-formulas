# Oatmeal Raisin Cookies

### Components

* 2 c all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 3/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1 1/2 c unsalted butter, softened (3 sticks)
* 1 c granulated sugar
* 1 c brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 3 c old fashioned oats
* 1 1/2 c raisins

### Assembly
* Preheat the oven to 375 degrees
* Line several baking sheets with parchment paper
* In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg
* In another bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the butter and both sugars on high until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes
* Scrape the bowl with a spatula, then beat in the vanilla and eggs
* Turn the mixer on low and slowly add in the flour mixture
* Scrape the bowl again then turn the mixer on low and mix in the oats and raisins
* Using a 1 1/2 tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop the dough into equal portions and spread the scoops out two inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets
* Bake for 12-14 minutes, until slightly golden around the edges
* Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets before moving.

### Notes
* First round was a half-batch that I used [Neat Egg](https://atlanticnaturalfoods.com/dima-portfolio/neat-the-neat-egg-substitute/); good results
