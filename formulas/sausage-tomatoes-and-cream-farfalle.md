# Farfalle with Sausage, Tomatoes, and Cream

### Components

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 pound sweet Italian sausages, casings removed
* 1/2 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
* 1 cup chopped onion
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes with added puree
* 1/2 cup whipping cream
* 1 pound farfalle (bow-tie pasta)
* 1/2 cup (packed) chopped fresh basil
* Freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese

### Assembly

1. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add sausage and crushed red pepper. Sauté until sausage is no longer pink, breaking up with back of fork, about 5 minutes.
3. Add onion and garlic; sauté until onion is tender and sausage is browned, about 3 minutes longer.
4. Add tomatoes and cream. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sausage mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.
6. Return pasta to same pot.
7. Add sausage mixture and toss over medium-low heat until sauce coats pasta, adding reserved cooking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls if mixture is dry.
8. Transfer pasta to serving dish. Sprinkle with basil. Serve, passing cheese separately.
