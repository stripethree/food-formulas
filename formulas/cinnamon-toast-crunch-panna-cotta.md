medium bowl. Wring the milk out of the cereal, set aside 2 1/2 cups for this recipe and refrigerate any remaining

_Panna Cotta_
* Pour 1 cup cereal milk into a small bowl and stir in gelatin; set aside
* In a medium saucepan, stir together heavy cream, remaining cereal milk, sugar, vanilla, and Patron. Bring to boil over medium heat, watching carefully as the cream will quickly rise to the top of the pan
* Pour gelatin and almond milk into cream mixture and stir until gelatin is completely dissolved
* Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly Remove from heat and pour into individual ramekins
* Leave ramekins uncovered at room temperature to cool
When cool, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours

I often serve this with some additional toasted and crumbled cereal on top.
