* 1 1/2 lb flank steak, sliced against the grain
* 4 medium zucchini

* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 tbs butter
* 1 lemon, juice and zest
* 1/4 c low-sodium chicken broth

### Assembly
* Combine the ingredients for the _marinade_  -  in an airtight container or a Ziploc bag

* Wash and trim the ends of the zucchini. Using a spiralizer, make the zucchini noodles, then set aside
* Bring the steak to room temperature and heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat â€” reserve the juices of the marinade for later
* Add the steak strips to the skillet in one layer and season with salt and pepper. Cook for one minute without stirring
* Add minced garlic and stir the steak for another minute or two to cook the other aside
* Remove the steak from the skillet and set aside to a plate
* In the same skillet, add butter, lemon juice and zest, red pepper flakes, chicken broth, and remaining marinade
* Bring to a simmer and allow to reduce for 2-3 minutes, stirring regularly
* Stir in the fresh parsley, then add the zucchini noodles and toss for two to three minutes
* Allow liquid to reduce for one minute if the zucchini renders too much water
* Add the steak strips back to the pan and stir for another minute and serve immediately
